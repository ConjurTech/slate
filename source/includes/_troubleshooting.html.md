# Troubleshooting

The following steps can be used to troubleshoot potential issues:

1. Check the [Data Types](#data-type) section and ensure your parameters have the correct formatting.
Possible issues include the address format, amount format, parameter casing, private key format,
wrong parameters included to be signed, wrong timestamp.

2. Trace each step of signing parameters using the example in
[Signing Request Parameters](#signing-request-parameters), this example has
the expected inputs and outputs at each step of generating a signature.
