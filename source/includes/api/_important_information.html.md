# Important Information

Subject                   | Things to note
------------------------- | ----------
[Addresses](#addresses)   | Addresses must be in the correct format.
[Amounts](#amounts)       | Amounts must be converted to the correct format.
[Contract Hash](#contracts) | The correct contract hash must be used depending on whether you are using the TestNet or MainNet endpoints.
[Parameter casing](#parameter-casing)          | Parameters must be snake cased: e.g. `contract_hash` and not `contractHash`
[Private keys](#private-keys)          | Private keys must be in the correct format.
[Signature](#signing-request-parameters) | Not all parameters should be included to generate the signature, excluded parameters are specified in their respective endpoint's documentation.
[Timestamp](#timestamp)   | If a timestamp parameter is required, then it should first be fetched from the server. If the timestamp is not within an acceptable range of the exchange's timestamp then an invalid signature error will be returned.

## Addresses
An `address` in Switcheo is always represented by a hex string, and should **never** be prefixed by `0x`.

## NEO Addresses

> Getting the user's address

```js
const { wallet } = require('@cityofzion/neon-js')
wallet.getScriptHashFromPublicKey('031c37f6cce9627dc635d026deddd1200013c1b78dac767cdb507339a831183fd9')
// Result: 87cf67daa0c1e9b6caa1443cf5555b09cb3f8e5f

// you can also retrieve the script hash from a wallet address directly with:
wallet.getScriptHashFromAddress('AQV8FNNi2o7EtMNn4etWBYx1cqBREAifgE')
// Result: 87cf67daa0c1e9b6caa1443cf5555b09cb3f8e5f
```

For NEO, an `address` refers to the [RIPEMD160](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIPEMD) hash of the the user's public key.

An example implemention to derive an `address` from a user's public key can be found in the
[neon-js javascript library](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neon-js/blob/5d61c31a5d6e5e2e29095e08c70d23449810b509/src/wallet/core.js#L92).

Please note the difference in terminology between Switcheo and neon-js. Switcheo's `address` is equivalent to neon-js's `scriptHash`.

## Amounts

When specifying amounts as request parameters, the amounts should first be converted by following these steps:

1. Multiply the original amount by 10 to the power of the precision allowed by the given token.
2. Drop any decimals, and convert the resulting integer to a string

For example, if the token's precision is `8`, and the original amount is `9.12345678`:

1. Following the above steps: `9.12345678 * (10 ^ 8)` = `912345678.00`
2. Drop any decimals to get: `912345678`
3. Convert the result to a string to get `"912345678"`

The list of supported assets and their corresponding precisions can be found in the [Tokens](#tokens) section.

## Parameter Casing

Parameters used to generate a signature or sent in API requests should always be snake cased.

Parameters are camel cased in the examples because the examples are in JavaScript and it is
JavaScript's convention to use camel case.

The code in the examples make use of helper methods to automatically convert camel cased keys into
snake casedÂ keys.


## Private Keys

Please check the documentation of the respective blockchains for signing with private keys.

For NEO, there is both a WIF and a private key.

Example WIF:
<code style=" hyphens: none;">
L479CJz4ZyxHiumy2viAjBFk8nixKeMY45DCQa5p4n4AT6M6WsWq
</code>

Example private key:
<code style=" hyphens: none;">
cd7b887c29a110e0ce53e81d6dd02805fc7b912718ff8b6659d8da42887342bd
</code>

The private key should be used for signing, not the WIF.
