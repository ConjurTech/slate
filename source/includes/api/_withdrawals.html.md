# Withdrawals

**Description**

Withdrawals allow free movement of tokens from the Switcheo smart contract into your wallet.
  This movement of tokens is free of charge.
  
Once a withdrawal has been executed, tokens in your contract balance would be deducted.
  Tokens that are put on hold by orders cannot be withdrawn.

Withdrawals are not instantaneous.
  Tokens deducted from your contract balance will be added to your wallet balance but put on hold until 
  the withdrawal has been fully executed.
