# Withdrawals

**Description**

Withdrawals allow free movement of tokens from the Switcheo smart contract into your wallet.
  This movement of tokens is free of charge.
  
Withdrawals can be done with tokens that are put on hold by orders.
  Once a withdrawal has been executed, tokens in your contract balance would be deducted.

Withdrawals are not instantaneous.
  Tokens deducted from your contract balance will be added to your wallet balance but put on hold until 
  the withdrawal has been fully executed.
